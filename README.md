Small project I started after finishing up class-roster-project for school to experiment with C++ and build upon what was learned. Never was fully finished but had all the basic functionality. Could store and retrieve multiple passwords for a site and encrypted them with the master password. Master password was hard coded(It was stored in the first line of the DB file encrypted, if it failed to decrypt to an expected string "login" would fail, if successful it would store the plaintext password in memory and use it to decrypt the stored passwords when accessed )as I never got around to adding the functionality to initiate a new password store. Ended up abandoning due to there being better established alternatives, as I didn't fully trust my methodology, and I moved on to java soon after. Was a nice learning experience into more advanced C++ than my school project. Dealing with the cryptography library was a big learning experience into processing data as byte arrays, as that was needed for the cryptography functionality.
